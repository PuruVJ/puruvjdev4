- title: Auto Class Launcher
  stack: golang
  description: >
    During online classes, you have to check which class next, then hunt the meet link of that class, then join.
    This is quite boring and repitive, so I automated it 😁 Auto Class launcher is a program written in Golang.
    You feed it your timetable, and leave it running in the background, it will open the classes 5 minutes before they start.
    No more checking timetable and hunting for links 😉
